BuilderNative.dll – Required for map rendering
==============================================

When you open a map, ODOOM Editor By NextGen World Ltd loads BuilderNative.dll to create the OpenGL render device. If you see:

  System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'BuilderNative': The specified module could not be found.

then BuilderNative.dll is missing or not next to Builder.exe.

Why the Build folder was empty
------------------------------
The Builder project used to run a "CleanOutputDirectory" step before every build that deleted
the entire Build\ folder. That wiped BuilderNative.dll (and everything else) before copying
the new Builder output, so after a build the folder could be empty or missing the DLL.
That pre-build clean has been removed so Build\ is no longer wiped; BuilderNative.dll and
Builder.exe now both stay in Build\ after a full build.

Fix:
-----
1. Build the full solution (Build → Build Solution), or build the Builder project.
   Builder depends on BuilderNative, so BuilderNative is built first and outputs to Build\,
   then Builder outputs to Build\. Both Builder.exe and BuilderNative.dll end up in Build\.

2. Use the same configuration and platform for both (e.g. Release | x64 for both).

3. Run Builder.exe from the Build\ folder (e.g. C:\Source\UltimateDoomBuilder\Build\). When you press F5 in
   Visual Studio, it runs from that folder (the project's output path).

4. If you use a build script, build the solution or at least Builder + BuilderNative.
   BuilderNative is Source\Native\BuilderNative.vcxproj (needs C++ workload in VS).

Architecture: Builder.exe (x64) requires BuilderNative.dll (x64). Win32 requires the Win32 DLL.
