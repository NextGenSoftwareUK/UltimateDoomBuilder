OASIS Display Pack – sprites for the editor
===========================================

PNG files here are named by OASIS thing type and used when drawing things on
the map (2D and 3D). Same thing types work in both Doom and OQuake: e.g. type 13
is the Silver Key – collect it in a Doom level, use it to open doors in OQuake.

Naming:  {thingType}.png  (e.g. 13.png = Silver Key, 5.png = Gold Key)

To (re)import Quake 1 sprites from your id1 folder, run:
  ExtractOquakeSprites.exe "C:\path\to\id1" "C:\path\to\this\Sprites\folder"
See IMPORT_FROM_QUAKE.txt in this folder.
